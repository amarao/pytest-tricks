# Tracebacks
Pytest excels at helping you with test failures.  After running your tests via
py.test, you will see an error report with a detailed traceback for each of the
failures, if any.  You can change the mode in which output is presented to you
via the ``--tb`` cli option:

```text
py.test --tb=auto    # (default) 'long' tracebacks for the first and last
                     # entry, but 'short' style for the other entries
py.test --tb=long    # exhaustive, informative traceback formatting
py.test --tb=short   # shorter traceback format
py.test --tb=line    # only one line per failure
py.test --tb=native  # Python standard library formatting
py.test --tb=no      # no traceback at all
```

tldr: Combine options ``-x``, ``-l``, ``--lf`` and ``--tb=long`` to analyze
results. Drop to the built-in debugger with ``--pdb``.
